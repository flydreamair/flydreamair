<p>There are strict&nbsp;border controls in place for all arrivals to the Territory, including returning Territorians.</p><p>All arrivals to the Northern Territory (NT) must:</p><ul><li>fill in a Border Entry Form</li><li>complete 14 days of <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/mandatory-supervised-quarantine">mandatory supervised quarantine</a> at your <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/quarantine-fee">own expense</a>*, if you have recently been in an active <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/hotspots-covid-19">declared COVID-19 hot spot</a>. This includes <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/unaccompanied-children-returning-from-a-hotspot">children returning from a hotspot</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="section1">Step 1. Check quarantine requirements</h2><p>You will have to quarantine if you have been in a <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/hotspots-covid-19">declared COVID-19 hotspot</a> in the 14 days before you arrive in the Territory. <br><br>This includes places that were declared hotspots after you visited them.</p><p>If you have been in a declared hotspot within the last 14 days but then spent time in an area that is not a hotspot immediately before crossing the NT border, that time will be deducted from your 14 days of quarantine.</p><p>For example, if you were in an area that is not a declared hotspot for 5 days immediately before crossing the NT border, those 5 days will now be counted as part of the required 14 day quarantine period. This means you will be required to quarantine for 9 days in the NT.</p><p>If travelling to or from an airport within a declared hotspot, <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/hotspots-covid-19">point 4 from the ‘Directions for COVID-19 Hotspots</a>’ provides advice.</p><h2 id="section2">Step 2. Fill in the Border Entry Form</h2><p>Do this online no more than 72 hours before entering the NT.</p><p>If you have a disability or impairment and require assistance please <a href="mailto:DOH.Exempt@nt.gov.au">request support</a>. We are able to help you access, complete and submit the required information on your behalf and arrange assistance on arrival if required</p><p><a class="au-btn external" href="https://forms.nt.gov.au/Produce/Form/COVID19/Northern%20Territory%20Border%20Entry%20Application/" target="_blank" referrer="noopener noreferrer">Border Entry Form</a></p><h2 id="section3">Step 3. Print your form</h2><p>Once you submit your application online, print it and bring it with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must provide your printed form on your arrival to the NT.</p><p>If you can't print your form you will need to complete a new Border Arrival Form on entry into the NT.</p><p>You may also be asked to provide proof that you have not recently come from or visited a <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/hotspots-covid-19">declared hotspot</a>.</p><p>Proof can be in the form of bank statements, fuel or accommodation receipts, campground receipts or other documents that establish your recent movements.</p><h2 id="section4">Step 4. Sign the declaration on arrival</h2><p>Your form will be reviewed by an authorised officer when you arrive.</p><p>You must declare relevant health information, including if you have been in a <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/travel/quarantine/hotspots-covid-19">declared COVID-19 hotspot</a> in the past 14 days and include all places you have visited in the past 28 days.</p><p>Major penalties apply for providing false information.</p><h2 id="section5">Step 5. Monitor your health</h2><p>COVID-19 is spread from person-to-person through close contacts and droplets.</p><p>The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect your family and friends is through maintaining good hygiene practices and physical distancing and stay home if you are unwell.</p><p>If you develop <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/symptoms-testing">symptoms</a> (fever, a cough, sore throat, loss of smell/taste or shortness of breath) arrange to <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/symptoms-testing">get tested</a>.</p><p>Contact a GP, respiratory clinic or call the NT COVID-19 hotline <a href="tel:1800008002" target="_blank" referrer="noopener noreferrer" class="external">1800 008 002</a> to arrange testing or for advice only call the National COVID-19 hotline <a href="tel:180020080" target="_blank" referrer="noopener noreferrer" class="external">1800 020 080</a>.</p><p>Download the <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app" target="_blank" referrer="noopener noreferrer" class="external">COVIDSafe app</a>. The app speeds up the process of finding and contacting people exposed to COVID-19. This helps health officials support and protect you, your friends and family.</p><h2 id="section6">Step 6. Keep up to date with declared Hotspots</h2><p>Traveller’s responsibilities as per NT Chief Health Officer COVID-19 Direction (No. 47).</p><p>If an area you have been in is declared a COVID-19 Hotspot within 14 days of your arrival in the NT, you must:</p><ul><li>Contact the COVID-19 Hotline on <a href="tel:1800008002" target="_blank" referrer="noopener noreferrer" class="external">1800 008 002</a> and identify yourself as a person who has been in an area that has been declared a Hotspot since you arrived in the NT.</li><li>If directed, you must submit to a test for COVID-19 infection.</li><li>Practice physical distancing (e.g. keep 1.5 metres away from others, stay home if unwell, sleep in a separate bedroom away from others, minimise contact with people) until 14 days has elapsed since your arrival into the NT.</li></ul><h2>Calculate your quarantine period</h2><p>Enter the day you arrived or the day you last had exposure to someone who tested positive to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
